# Rimworld: Avian Races (Puddi Edition)

A very quick and dirty update of [Mlei's Avian Races (Continued)](https://github.com/emipa606/AvianRaces) mod.

## Notes

* No support for pre-1.5 Rimworld.
* Probably supports Anomaly (untested).
* Cosmetic tweaks made to owls:
    * No hair styles.
    * No thin body type.
    * Slightly longer description.

## Installation

1. Download the latest Release.
1. Extract it into your Rimworld Mods directory, examples:
    * Rimworld Mods directory location: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods`.
    * Correct installation:  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\avian_races_puddi_edition`.
1. Launch Rimworld.
1. Open the Mods menu.
1. Enable "Avian Races (Puddi Edition)".

_Note: I have no plans to make this available on the Steam Workshop at this time._
